This mini project is basically a hospital data simulation mechanism, simulated using simmpy module of Python and displayed using Tkinter module of Python.
It has some following features:
1. Run Simulation - This button gives us all the information of the arrival time, treatment time and triage level of the patient.
2. Patient's info - This button gives us a brief information like: Patient id, treatement time, age, sex, etc.
3. Bar Graph - With the help of this button we can plot a bar graph to visualise the statistics more clearly.
